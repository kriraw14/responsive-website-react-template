**Customizable:** Easily customize the template to match your restaurant's branding, colors, and menu.

**Navigation:** A responsive navigation bar is included, allowing users to easily navigate through different sections of the website.

**Menu Display:** Showcase your restaurant's menu with images, descriptions, and prices.

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks/libraries used to bootstrap your project. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgments section. Here are a few examples.

* React
* mui
more libraries info can be found in package.json
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

**Declarative:** React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.
Component-Based: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep the state out of the DOM.
Learn Once, Write Anywhere: We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.
